# HelpNvOptimus
**This repository or you can so say the article is created for clear installation of nvidia drivers for those laptops with optimus cards that hang intentionally.**

For example: you want to switch to linux, but you have a laptop on optimus card and so when you start in livecd (debinst, yast inst does not concern) hangs intentionally in video drivers nouveau or even with proprtar drivers. And you do not understand what to do.

There is a utility from nvidia called `bumblebee`for the video cards themselves, but it is long unsupported but still used. But it will have the same problem.

There are many utilities to customize optimus such as:
* [optimus-manager](https://github.com/askannz/optimus-manager) - utility for Arch linux
* [Envycontrol](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol) - script from bayasdev, which edits configs. And adding xrandr commands from session managers.
* nvidia-prime - Utility from ubuntu, also changes the configs
